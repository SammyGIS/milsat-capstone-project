# Overview
This project focuses on validating the accuracy and reliability of health facility location data in Borno State, Nigeria. The state has faced significant healthcare challenges due to conflicts and emergencies, leading to the displacement of people and the destruction of critical infrastructure, including healthcare facilities. To improve healthcare delivery and resource allocation, it is essential to assess and validate the existing health facility locations.

The project aims to address the problem of inaccurate and outdated healthcare facility data by leveraging satellite imagery and spatial analysis techniques. By cross-referencing population data with reported health facility locations, the project seeks to identify any discrepancies or inaccuracies in the data. The validation process will ensure that healthcare planning and resource allocation are based on reliable and up-to-date information.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
* Validate the accuracy of health facility location data in Borno State, Nigeria.
* Cross-reference reported health facility locations with population data and satellite imagery to identify discrepancies.
* Assess the accessibility of health facilities by analyzing their proximity to the population distribution.
* Identify any inaccuracies, outdated information, or discrepancies in the reported health facility data.
* Contribute to improving healthcare planning efforts and resource allocation in Borno State.
* Provide valuable insights for stakeholders, policymakers, and organizations involved in post-conflict recovery and healthcare interventions.
* Enhance access to quality healthcare services and support the overall well-being and development of the region.

## Findings

* The visualizations provide valuable insights into the distribution of health facilities and the population in Borno State. The number of health facilities in each LGA indicates the availability of healthcare services in different areas. By comparing this information with population density, we can identify areas that may be underserved or require additional healthcare resources.

* The analysis also highlights the percentage of invalidated health facility data, indicating potential inaccuracies in the reported locations. This emphasizes the need for data validation processes to ensure the reliability of the dataset used for healthcare planning and resource allocation.

* The maps visually depict the population distribution in Borno State, allowing for a better understanding of the areas with higher population density. The point map of health facility locations helps visualize the spatial distribution of healthcare services.

* Overall, the visualizations provide insights that can inform decision-making in terms of healthcare planning, resource allocation, and identifying underserved areas. They contribute to creating solutions and business intelligence that can enhance access to quality healthcare services and address the healthcare challenges faced in Borno State.
